### Introduction:

This section introduces indexDb and localStorage as client side front end tools. It also provides a list of criteria with which both tools will be compared.

### Web Workers

One major difference between IndexDB and LocalStorage is that IDB due to its relationship with web workers is asynchronous where LS is not. This section states how this simple difference can impact performance and user experience.

- Data processing
- async processing
- concurency

### Data Structures

IDB and LS are also different in that they LS can only accept strings, where IDB can receive more complex data base structures. This section explains how this can impact the developer workflow

### Versioning and Migration

Where IDB has inbuilt features for updating the database, LS has to do this manually. This section explores the Versioning and Migration phenomenon, and explains its impact on codebase, and data integrity

### Data Integrity

This section explores the impact of data strutures, and versioning capabilities of both tools, and how they affect your data.

### Storage size

This section explores the nunces of storage sizes in both tools.

### Ease of use

IDB is complex whereas LS is simple. This section explores how this impacts developers

### Browser support

This section explores how both tools interract with browsers.

### Use cases

This section is the conclusing section and uses all we know to recommend ideal use cases for both tools.
